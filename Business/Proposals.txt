Hi, 

My name is Krupa and I am the Founder of Alpha Studios. Its my dream to create innovative mobile games for Android and iOS, with a mission to release multiple titles across many genres. We’re seeking $1M investment for 30% Partnership with our company. We have a clear roadmap to launch 4 games every year and reach break even within 3 years.

Our revenue model includes in-app purchases, ads, and exclusive content, offering significant growth potential. I’d love to discuss how your investment could help us achieve our vision.

After 3 years or maybe sooner and there is a 83% chance that we can earn more than a million dollars every year for life.

Best regards,
Krupanandareddy
