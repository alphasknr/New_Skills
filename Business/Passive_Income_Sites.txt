Hi, My name is Krupa. I am an Indie Game Developer. As a game developer, I create high quality graphic assets for my games. I create most of my designs with GIMP and Adobe Softwares. I also have a partnership with other POD Sites such as Spring, TeePublic, Zazzle.I want to make my designs more popular around the world and Amazon is the best platform to make it possible.I create various types of designs, such as Doodle, Graphic, Quotes and Holiday Themed designs. Thanks for the opportunity.
